Usage of GitHub for project management:
\vspace{1ex}
\newline
Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic 
task management tools for every project. 
\newline
Hence this will help us to share our projects and tasks online also take help from others projects in case we are lagging in some resources, such as library for arduino, library for cloud management,etc.
